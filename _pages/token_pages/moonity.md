## Moonity

Moonity (ticker: MOONI) is the first charity token to exist on the Harmony blockchain. The token itself is relatively new (launched on 21.05.2021) but has already made some noise in the Harmony space. With it's cute little mascot and it's generously giving 'tax' implementation; holding and trading Moonity benefits everyone around.

Moonity was launched on the Harmony mainnet with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) tokens, with a 50% burn happening on their creation causing a 'black hole' (burn) effect to start.  5% was also kept aside for dev supply.

Let's break it down a little bit. So every time Moonity is traded, a 12% tax (known as slippage) is taken from the amount. At first, you may be thinking that 12% is fairly high - and in terms of trading large amounts of the token, it certainly could be. But let's break it down a little bit so you can see what this tax truly is:

- 6% is stored in the liquidity pool
  - Storing tokens in the liquidity pool will help ensure stable liquidity throughout the existence of the token
- 3% is reflected
  - Reflected tokens are sent to everyone who is currently holding Moonity in their wallet. I for one didn't truly understand this at first as I had never been a part of a reflected token before but after holding for some time, I can truly confirm that it literally just works. Every time someone trades - I get free tokens!
- 3% goes to charity
  - The owner of Moonity has set up a wallet to specifically hold charity donations. Every transaction performed results in 3% being sent directly to a wallet that is later given to charity (more on this shortly).

Looking at the above, like I previously said. It can end up equating to a large sum of tokens depending on how much is sent but I personally think the approach the token takes is fair for all parties. The developers/owners of the token benefit by having their token remain stable (with regards to liquidity), anyone who is holding the token (whether its FOMO or true love) benefit every time a transaction is made and finally, my favourite feature of the coin, every body is donating to charity!

I don't want to go to deep into any numbers, however for clarity I want to give a quick overview of making some transactions for you to see the 'true cost' of using Moonity. This for me isn't a turn off, but I don't want you to read this - think it's great and then moan on Telegram that you got 'scammed' and lost out (Yes, it's happened. Especially when people FOMO'd on the ATH - but that's just standard crypto).

**Breaking It Down a Little More With Examples**

- User A: 0xAAAA
- User B: 0xBBBB
- Charity: 0xCCCC
- Liquidity Pool: 0xDDDD

**Relatively Small Transaction**

User A sends User B "1000" MOONI

As can be seen in the above diagram, the proportion of tokens 'lost' due to the tax brackets is relatively small.

**Much Larger Transaction**

User A sends User B "1,000,000" MOONI

![Large tx](/assets/images/token_pages/moonity/2_moonity_tx_example.png)

Compared to the small transaction, the about of tokens 'lost' by the receiver is much larger and could be worth a lot of fiat depending on the market. To me, personally, I like the mechanics behind the token so although this would be a personal hit to User B as the receiver of the tokens, they can find peace knowing that they have also given a large proportion to charity and their fellow token holders!

### Donations By the ComMoonity

The first donation made by the Moonity community totaled 53,683 ONE which at the time was worth roughly 2 ETH. The community voted on the target charity which would receive the raised money, resulting in 2 separate leading charities:

- Orangutan Outreach: https://redapes.org/
- International Medical Corps: https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/

1 ETH (26,841 ONE) were donated to both of the above charities directly. This incredible amount of money was raised in just 9 days of the tokens launch, raising excitement across the board and proving that the token's direction was helping those outside of the community as well as all of those involved with MOONI!
