## Who?

I spend my day to day hacking companies (legally) but have a pretty deep background in software development. I've spent a long time playing with Cryptocurrencies, trading and reading white papers. I've attempted to hit the moon multiple times, but sadly never landed there (not even close).

Now is the time I finally learn how to write tech on the blockchain, specifically smart contracts in Solidity. I am targeting the Harmony network specifically rather than the Ethereum network. I love the protocol, the community is great and to be honest, the non-existent fees (negligible) and 2 second finality (2 block time finality) is just far too attractive.

Almost all other blockchain tutorials I have seen online all focus on the Ethereum blockchain, so I am going against the grain and focusing my efforts of working with the Harmony testnet and not just running on the ganache-cli. Lot's of posts will be trial and error, I'm sure the days will be full of mistakes but that's the best way to learn!

## Why?

I just want to learn how blockchain tech works from the developer's point of view, carve out some smart contracts myself and maybe even get close enough to minting something custom. Either way, documenting every step of the

## Donate

I'm doing this for me, but the Harmony community seems fantastic so far so if I can contribute in these early stages by helping others get involved, showing newbies how to develop on the blockchain or even just giving you something to read then feel free to donate. I am currently hodl-ing $ONE and $MOONI:
