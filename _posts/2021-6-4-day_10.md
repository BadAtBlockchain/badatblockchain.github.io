### Double Digits! Digging into HRC721 With Open Zeppelin

I did it! I reached 10 days - wooh! As a quick breakdown of figures, I have probably averaged around 3 hours a day on this so. 30 hours in across a week and a half is actually pretty good going considering I'm working full time and attempting to live some sort of life around that too. Overall, my progress has felt incredible. Solidity is becoming easier to read and I am consuming other smart contracts at a really nice rate! I've even comfortably been able to jump onto a number of token Github accounts and start reading their code to attempt to understand their tokenomics/mechanics from the other side. No where near the level of an audit, but my own due diligence before I gamble my money.

One thing I have been hinting at throughout the past 10 days is wanted to be up to date with Solidity, from both a version perspective and a 'coding standards' perspective. One of the common denominators I am seeing across many projects is the use of Open Zeppelin contracts as abstract/base contracts. These can all be viewed on their [Github](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts). 

Yesterday, I mentioned about starting off tinkering with the [NFT Store](https://github.com/harmony-one/nft-store) project from the people at Harmony. I figured this was likely a perfect start at building something myself and utilising 'recommended' practices from the team themselves. In my head, it can't be a bad thing - unless the code is old, deprecated and awful. But that's also fine too, because learning is half the battle - right?

I have spent a couple of hours today cleaning up the project, removing a lot of bloat that I don't need and just getting it to a nice base for me to start with. To be honest, I've actually remove a pretty large amount of code altogether. The original project was designed in a way for anyone to create an item on the store and have other members buy and mint these NFT's. A price can be set, and a minting limit. It's basically a lightweight version of [DaVinci](https://davinci.gallery/) for us simpletons to understand easier! What has been extremely handy though, is being able to see the order in which functions are utilised, how the smart contract is set up to go from 'sale' to 'mint' and how much work is done by the Open Zeppelin contracts too.

From what I can see, they already do the following:

- help with minting safely
- store maps of address and NFT ids
- handle math safely
- help the contract track how many tokens have been minted altogether
- and much more, but I haven't come across these in use yet.

There are a few extra things I am going to implement on top to help gain some further insight:

- creating the actual NFT content
- map the unique NFT data to the token id, which is then mapped by the Open Zeppelin contract
- allow a user to query a token id and receive the NFT data, owner, etc
- implement a simple form of trading/swapping tokens with other owners (this existed in NFT Store, but I have already deleted to force myself to rewrite the logic from scratch)

I appreciate I haven't actually disclosed my idea yet. Again, I don't want to ruin anything but at the same I don't want to massively fail. If it flops, I'll pitch the idea here and post the code in the state of where I failed. If it succeeds, I'll actually try and mint it and launch it for feedback! It's on Harmony anyway, so worst case, people think it's pants but still don't mind spending 1 $ONE on a unique item *crosses fingers and toes*.

I've pushed the 'base' of the project to a [public repository](https://github.com/BadAtBlockchain/NFT-Base) for you to check out and hopefully have a go at building something yourself too! The code can be used by:

1. Have truffle already installed
2. Clone the repository
3. run 'npm install' within the directory
4. compile, migrate and test the contract (I personally use the 'testnet' as my network choice)

Several notable changes I have made to the code can be seen in the following snippets.

Removing the different stores/user sales to just buying from the contract owner for a static value:

```javascript
function purchaseWithONE() public nonReentrant payable {
    uint256 weiAmount = msg.value;
    require(weiAmount != 0, "Crowdsale: weiAmount is 0");
    require(msg.sender != address(0), "Crowdsale: beneficiary is the zero address");
    uint128 price = 1000000000000000000;
    require(weiAmount == price, "Crowdsale: weiAmount does not equal price");

    //transfer funds to owner
    owner.transfer(msg.value);

    //mint and send the token
    _mint(msg.sender);
}
```

The internal call to _mint() eventually ends up calling the HRC721 token's function:

```javascript
function mintArtwork(address to) public returns (uint256) {
    bytes32 hashed = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(totalEverMinted, block.timestamp, to));
    uint256 tokenId = uint(hashed);

    // TODO: this should be safe right? Index will be the current minted total? 0,1,2,3,etc
    _allArtworks[totalEverMinted] = tokenId;
    totalEverMinted = totalEverMinted.add(1);

    mint(to, tokenId);

    return tokenId;
}
```

I should note, the map '_allArtworks' maps the hashed token ID to an index which simply increments each time an object is minted. This will be used to help map the underlying contracts map which links addresses and ID's with the unique NFT content. This will eventually be linked together with:

```javascript
function getArtworkByID(uint256 id) public view returns (string memory) {
    require(id < totalEverMinted, "ID requested has not been created yet");

    uint256 tokenID = _allArtworks[id];
    require(tokenID > 0, "TokenID was not found in artwork collection");

    return "FOUND NFT WITH TOKEN";
}
```

At this time, I don't do anything with the token id and hashed content above however I have some plans. If you have been following my posts you might be able to piece things together and get an idea but if not - it hopefully be to long until I announce some form of progress and project! 10 days and I'm already feeling comfortable and confident enough to build something, that's pretty cool!

Finally, the tests I have deployed can be used to check the current logic that is implemented:

```javascript
it("Should mint with ONE", async () => {
    const tryMint = await crowdsale.purchaseWithONE({value: price})
    const total = await hrc721.totalEverMinted()
})

it("Should get artwork by index id", async () => {
    const artwork = await hrc721.getArtworkByID(0)
    console.log(artwork);
})
```

As shown above, I attempt to mint/purchase an NFT from the contract and then simply attempt to obtain the data. Now, although I haven't actually got any pass/fail assert statements within the test cases (bad developer) I have used the second test case to output the obtained data which shouldn't work at all if the first test doesn't pass (hopefully my brain is right). Based on the following screenshot, this behaviour can be seen to be successful:

### My Review of the Last 10 Days

I LOVE SOLIDITY. I LOVE BLOCKCHAIN. I LOVE HARMONY. I LOVE TRUFFLE.

So the above pretty much sums it up. I have been having a really good time working through this personal challenge. Learning a new language. Discovering so much more about smart contracts than I ever knew existed. I understood that these protocols could run code, but I honestly didn't know how complex and overwhelming it can get. Ethereum truly was a revolution, and now we can all ride the wave and live the (cheaper and faster) Harmony dream! So many good projects are out, some brilliant DEX platforms, yield farming is just money printing for lazy people and the technology on a whole is unbelievably cool. I'm even enjoying using JavaScript to write test cases (which I never thought I'd say). All this development is making me want me to look at full time opportunities and a possible shift in that direction. 

"But Bad, it's only been 10 days. Don't rethink your career" - someone, 2021

That's okay, it's been done before. I'm sure I will do it again. As long as I have fun along the way then I'm pretty relaxed about it. Speaking of, if you have any ideas you want to collaborate on. Whether it's a fun project, a serious project or even just some blog post type work - let me know! I'm 100% up for it.
