### Minted My Own NFTs!

A couple of weeks back I started working on a fun little project I have called Orbitals. Orbitals is a collection of 42 randomly generated images of planets orbiting around a primary 'sun'. Initially these were pretty simple shapes just pasted onto a PNG. However, after several refactors I came up with a nice little script that gave me a good range of random creations. Ranging from planet count, planet moons, orbit rings, random star fields across the background, colour gradients for all planets and twinkling animation for each and every star!

Being an SVG, the animations are baked into a mathematically scaling image that just keeps on going. These can easily be embedded on websites too, keeping their animated state.

At this time, the script is not publicly visible however if anyone is interested in checking it out with the idea of creating their own project and minting their own NFT's then let me know and I'll sort something out!

To see the NFT's, please visit [https://opensea.io/assets/orbitals](https://opensea.io/assets/orbitals).

To check out all integrity hashes for each one, please check out [https://badatblockchain.github.io/nfts/orbitals](https://badatblockchain.github.io/nfts/orbitals)
