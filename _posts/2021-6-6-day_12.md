### Sundays

I had planned to start working on a Dapp today, specifically something that revolved around either a custom currency or a custom NFT. This did not go perfectly according to plan. Instead I ended up reading through the [DaVinci](https://davinci.gallery/) smart contracts to see how they had approached minting and hosting NFTs. These are available on their [Github](https://github.com/harmony-one/davinci_nft_marketplace/tree/master/contracts).

As DaVinci is on the Harmony network, the platform is still relatively quiet and is waiting for the world to see Harmony and notice it's potential. I for one am a huge fan of both Harmony and Ethereum, but trading on the Ethereum platform comes at a weighty cost and if there is a cheaper/faster solution, then I don't see a negative. I also appreciate that many people (especially on the internet) are very precious and protective about the things they love. Trying to get someone to use a platform and claiming it's "better" than theirs is naturally going to trigger their defense mechanisms.**

** Before you react, I am not saying Harmony is better. Calm yourself!

Looking at the smart contracts, there is a range of functionality that I am still not familiar with and some Solidity that is still going over my head. As the time comes, they will make more sense and in theory, I should be able to just read through the contracts as easily as I can read through languages such as C#, Python, JavaScript (etc). Of course Solidity appears very similar to JavaScript but there is a range of things that are still yet to click with me. I think it's a merge of blockchain lingo/trends and the language itself. By the end of these 100 days though, I will *hopefully* be perfectly capable of reading a contract and understanding it without even knowing the product and/or interacting with it.

Using DaVinci gives a good understanding of the platform itself based on feedback the application gives the user as products are being created. Similar to other platforms, they use IPFS to host the NFT content data (images, gifs, 3D models, videos, etc) in a decentralized manner. The DaVinci HRC721 (ERC721) tokens are then linked to the IPFS hosted data to permanently 'create' the asset on the blockchain. These are then assigned to the minters/buyers wallet address. These can then be sold on or traded, with an optional fee for the original seller (assigned at initial upload time).

I for one will be using this platform in the near future to dabble with some NFT's. Testing my coding skills to see if I can create some form of 'art' to sell. It's unlikely due to the amount of noise in NFTs at the moment, but if it's received well then it could act as a good proof of concept or market research for future ventures!

### Web Application Code

This isn't strictly related to my #100daysofcode venture, but I wanted to make a brief note of it as it took some time today. I was working on some frontend code that would ultimately help in me launching a Dapp in the future. It is likely that I will be using a framework such as React when building a product I plan to launch, however for now I have just been messing around with vanilla languages such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript to build some small interactive applications. These can then easily use web3 frameworks to help with talking to smart contracts (via the use of MetaMask, or similar).

There isn't anything to show at this point in time - however, it's baby steps towards a bigger product!

As always, I'm around if anyone wants to try and build something. If anyone wants to collaborate. If you have been following my progress you will see I am far beyond 'pro' with Solidity, but I'm eager and motivated to get as good as I can and ultimately build some really cool products! Nudge me on Twitter and let's collab!
