### Today Was Quiet

Being the weekend, real life things normally catch up with me. It's a little harder for me to just disappear into the abyss and code away without needing to do anything a normal human should probably be doing. That being said, I was able to catch up on some reading and documentation that I hadn't ran through just yet. I figured rather than digging in today I would just leave a list of everything below for your own reading if you are interested. In theory, everything here will help future steps with my Solidity code - just a shame it's been a few days without code snippets of my own take on things. Hopefully that will change tomorrow and I'll get some more progress and post something up!

### Bonus Round: Social Experiment Token (1MIL)

1MIL is a social experiment that was created on the Harmony blockchain. According to their [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/ny314y/onemillion_1mil_a_micro_cap_social_experiment_on/) the token was designed to test buyers and attempt to limit their greed and whaling capabilities that many new token projects attract. These eventually lead to the whole trading trends such as pump and dumps, and can even end up with a token being rugged. 

1MIL has a few interested points to make, these are lifted from the Reddit above:

- Hard limit of 1 million tokens that have all been minted and provided straight away
- No burns
- No manual minting
- No airdrops
- Liquidity is set to a dead/null address. No chance of rug pull.

The 'experiment' side of the token is purely an ask/favour from the owner. There are no coded rules in place, however there is one specific (written) rule that has been pitched in an attempt to help with the tokens progression:

> don't try and whale, it is bad for the project and will actively work against you

This is the main experiment. The coin is testing people's personal greed. There is nothing against buying and selling the coin during the dips (infact the Reddit post even mentioned a user that dumped at 50000%). Everyone has their own goals, everyone has different levels of risk and whether the profit is 100%, 1000% or even higher, these sums of money can very quickly add up and even change a persons real life situation in that moment.
