### Do I need to Implement SafeMath?

To start off todays coding session, I want to look at [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol) and figure out what I should get used to using it. After reading into the library itself (and posts like [this](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/2465)), it appears that Solidity 0.8.0 actually implemented safer arithmetic which reduces the overhead of using SafeMath (not confirmed personally). The reduced overhead lowers the overall gas expense for transactions. As I am new to Solidity, I am going to try and stick with the more recent versions of Solidity and attempt to stay as updated as possible with regards to the language.

I appreciate the above question was not really answered very well, other than me just jumping to the newer version. But basically, I need to ensure my arithmetic is not vulnerable to overflows and underflows, causing wrap around vulnerabilities. SafeMath was designed to prevent this and is used by many smart contracts everywhere. Now that Solidity does these checks by default, it seems like utilising an external library is not required anymore. It should be noted that working with versions before Solidity 0.8.0, the math is all unchecked and extra precautions should be taken.

####  Updating to Solidity 0.8.0

For that reason, I removed and updated truffle to the latest:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

I refactored all of my Solidity files to pragma 0.8.0 as a minimum:

```javascript
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```

And finally, replaced the compiler version for the project within the truffle-config.js file:

```
compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "^0.8.0",
      settings: {
        optimizer: {
          enabled: true,
          runs: 200,
        },
      },
    },
  },
```

I believe this was everything I needed to do to update my scripts, ready for compilation.

```bash
bc@ubuntu:~/Desktop/newbcoin$ truffle compile -all

Compilation failed. See above.
Truffle v5.3.8 (core: 5.3.8)
Node v14.17.0
```

As can be seen above, that went terribly. I will dig into each one and attempt to narrow down all warnings and errors to have a clean compilation once again.

#### Constructor Visibility

The first warning I came across, which appeared 3 times, was the following:

```
Warning: Visibility for constructor is ignored. If you want the contract to be non-deployable, making it "abstract" is sufficient.
```

The warning is pretty self explanatory, to remove this I simply removed the "public" keyword from my constructor declaration. In this case, my contracts are not abstract (except the DumberToken) and require deployment.

Before:

```
constructor() public {
    name = "Dumb Token!";
    supply = 10000;
}
```

After:

```
constructor() {
	name = "Dumb Token!";
    supply = 10000;
}
```

Recompiling shows these warnings were now removed:

![warnings gone](/assets/images/day_4/1_warnings_gone.png)

Final note, as I inherit the DumberToken contract to give the DumbToken contract a "name" variable, I set this to be an abstract contract:

```
abstract contract DumberToken {
    string public name;
}
```

#### Override Functions

The final compiler issues were specifically focused on the functions implemented from the interface I added yesterday (if you didn't see that or don't know what an interface is, quickly go check it out - it's not in depth but should be enough).

One of the 2 errors I was faced with was:

```
TypeError: Overriding function is missing "override" specifier.
  --> /home/bc/Desktop/newbcoin/contracts/DumbToken.sol:21:5:
   |
21 |     function totalSupply() external view returns (uint) {
   |     ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).
Note: Overridden function is here:
 --> /home/bc/Desktop/newbcoin/contracts/DumbToken.sol:5:5:
  |
5 |     function totalSupply() external view returns (uint);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

If I didn't know how interfaces worked, then at this point I'd be pretty confused. But knowing what virtual/override functions are from other languages, this was a pretty straight forward issue. But an excellent error to catch early on in my Solidity adventure as it opens up more knowledge of how inheritance (etc) works in this language!

To fix this, I simply followed the error and declared the target functions as 'override' functions:

```
function totalSupply() override external view returns (uint) {
	return supply;
}
```

As can be seen above, the "override" keyword was added after the function name, in-line with the external and view keywords. Note: the declaration in the interface does not need this keyword.

Compilation, migration and testing all succeeded after the port to Solidity ^0.8.0!

```
  Contract: NewbCoin
    ✓ should put 10000 NewbCoin in the first account (421ms)
    ✓ should call a function that depends on a linked library (904ms)
    ✓ tax should exist (671ms)
    ✓ should send coin correctly (6598ms)


  4 passing (9s)
```

#### Updating the 'Math' to Utilise 0.8.0's Arithmetic

So, earlier on I mentioned that using the built in math with default underflow/overflow checks lower gas overheads... well, I didn't read the patch notes and believed what I read of Stack (standard). To rival the original post I read, here is the official line from the [patch notes](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/080-breaking-changes.html):

> Checks for overflow are very common, so we made them the default to increase readability of code, even if it comes at a slight increase of gas costs.

I personally haven't ran any tests, but I'm sure over time it will become more apparent and when attempting to optimise my smart contracts I will be paying far more attention to gas. Although, let's be serious, I am developing for Harmony... not Ethereum (*winky face*).

Upon reading further into the notes, the following line seems to state that my current math usage is now safe by default and shouldn't need to be changed at all:

> - Optional: If you use SafeMath or a similar library, change `x.add(y)` to `x + y`, `x.mul(y)` to `x * y` etc.

An additional note on this, it is still possible to have 'wrap-around' arithmetic, but should only be used when and where required. In order to ensure this still occurs, and the developers wants an integer to overflow/underflow around it's max/min value, the 'unchecked' keyword can be used:

```
unchecked {
	return a - b;
}
```

#### Something I Missed and Feel require()'d to Note

As the title says, I missed a change I made to the project that I feel is a pretty important area. Previously, when I was doing some logic checks to prevent illegal logic/functionality, I was using simple if statements and then returning immediately if the if resulted in a true. An example of this can be seen below:

```
if (balances[msg.sender] < _amount) 
	return false;
```

In this above snippet, if the sender's balance is less than the amount they want to send, the function panics and backs out early. This will likely throw an error to the user in the app, or just silently fail causing the user to triple check their funds and make sure they didn't get scammed (been there multiple times).

The important bit about this section is that I have now replaced all of these logic checks with 'require()' functions. They effectively act the same way, but when reading the code it actually appears to be more English friendly than an if statement, which I honestly never thought would be achievable:

```
require(balances[msg.sender] > _amount, "The senders balance must be more than the amount requested to send");
```

What we have here is the same statement/logic check as the "if" statement above, however the comparison operator is the other way around. Here, it basically says that the senders balance requires more than the requested amount to send. So when read in English, I see "I require more balance than amount sent to pass". If it fails, the string is thrown and the logic returns out of the function breaking execution flow. How it passes, the function flow continues as normal.

According to [BitDegree](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/solidity-require#assert-and-require), if a require() statement fails then no transaction gas is returned. This is extremely valuable information when developing smart contracts ensuring that the end user is kept safe and trusts the logic at all times.

#### Coming Up...

I did start working on something else today but it hasn't reached a point which I can write much content about it, or even commit it as it's not got working tests assigned to it. But fingers crossed it's ready for tomorrows post! Today was more clean up and reading into the differences between older and newer versions of Solidity. All handy information for future dev!
