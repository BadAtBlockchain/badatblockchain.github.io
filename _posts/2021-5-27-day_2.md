### Visual Updates

Day 2 of my #100daysofcode initially revolved around changing up my pages themeing. The default layout is clean and minimal but I didn't feel it was presenting my posts in a manner I was happy with. To do this, I migrated my already existing content to the [Tales](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme, one which I have used before and really like!

### Continuing With the MetaCoin Smart Contract

After yesterdays success of unboxing the MetaCoin and porting the configuration to work with the Harmony testnet, I wanted to start customising the project on a whole and making it a little more of my own. This started off with effectively replacing all the MetaCoin names and references to be 'NewbCoin', and attempting a recompile.

Once compiled, I attempted to migrate to the testnet:

```bash
truffle migrate --network testnet --reset
```

To test the migration manually, we can connect to the testnet using the truffle console and check our deployment.

```bash
truffle console --network testnet
```

We can now perform manual tests, similar to those that are in the test/ directory seen yesterday (day 1). The quickest, as far as I know, way to check it deployed correctly is by seeing if our newly migrated Smart Contract was given an address on the blockchain.

We can do this by:

1. Obtaining a reference to the deployed Smart Contract
2. Logging the public 'address' variable

This can be seen below:

I adapted the test file to reference the new artifact (NewbCoin), but when attempting to execute the tests again - I came across a error that I have never seen before:

```bash
bc@ubuntu:~/Desktop/newbcoin$ truffle test --network testnet
Using network 'testnet'.


Compiling your contracts...

As all good developers do, I guessed how to fix it and attempted the above command again but with the '--reset' switch, but was offensively pushed back by a "> Warning: possible unsupported (undocumented in help) command line option: --reset" warning.

The next port of call with Google! Which lead me to this [Github issue](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/2724), thankfully disclosing the "--all" switch when compiling.

```bash
bc@ubuntu:~/Desktop/newbcoin$ truffle compile --all

Once attempting to run the tests after the above, I started to see some progress!

### Implementing a Basic Transaction Tax

Several tokens on the Harmony network have implemented a form of tax for each transaction. One of my favourite coins that I current hold is Moonity (MOONI) and performs a 12% tax on each transaction. This is broken down further but that's out of scope for todays post.

For my implementation, I aim to tax each transaction at 10%. This tax will occur after the sender has had their amount removed from the total but before the receiver is granted the new tokens. To implement this simply, I created the following private function:

```javascript
function _taxTransaction(uint _amount) private returns(uint postTax, uint removed) {
    uint _toRemove = _amount / tax;
    emit TransactionTax(_amount, (_amount - _toRemove), _toRemove);
    return ((_amount - _toRemove), _toRemove);
}
```

As can be seen above, _taxTransaction() simply takes the current transfer amount, calculates how much to remove relative to the tax variable and returns 2 values:

1. the new amount, after being taxed
2. the amount of tax taken

It should be noted that I haven't added any rules or requirements for this function so it is likely not production ready but testing will help highlight any additional logic or steps that should be implemented.

To adhere to the function requires about, I created the following to Contract member variables:

```javascript
uint tax = 10; // percentage of the transaction

event TransactionTax(uint _preTax, uint _postTax, uint _tax);
```

I was now ready to utilise this function in an attempt to tax every future transfer. This was done by tweaking the existing sendCoin() function:

```javascript
function sendCoin(address _receiver, uint _amount) public returns(bool sufficient) {
    if (balances[msg.sender] < _amount) 
    	return false;

    balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

    // tax mechanic here for every transaction, removes the percentage specified in 'uint tax'
    uint _removed = 0;
    (_amount, _removed) = _taxTransaction(_amount);
    _burn(_removed); // Currently does nothing
    balances[_receiver] += _amount;

    emit Transfer(msg.sender, _receiver, _amount);

	return true;
}
```

As can be seen, a new local variable is created (_removed) and initialised to a value of 0. The two values are caught from the _taxTransaction() function as explained above. Note, that we alter the value of the _amount variable before the receivers total is altered. In theory, the sender will lose 100% of the transfer, and the receiver will receive 90% of the amount (due to the 10% tax rate specified in the member variable). Naturally I can set this to whatever I want, but whole numbers are easy to work with and spot early issues!

Note: We can ignore the _burn() function for now, as this literally does nothing other than receive the amount and return it. This skeleton will be my attempt at locking the token or "/dev/null"-ing the tokens, but that will require a little research to get right.

I attempted to compile my new smart contract, and to my amazement it compiled first time! Victory.

Running the tests did not prove so successful, but based on previous tests I already expected these too fail:

![Successfully failing tests](/assets/images/day_2/4_tax_test_fail.png)

As can be seen in the screenshot above, the transfer test failed as the receiver did NOT receive the amount that was transferred. Although the test failed, I can see that our logic actually succeeded based on the 'actual' and 'expected' values in the output. I just need to tweak the rules of the test to make sure it expects the taxed value.

First I wanted to make sure my tax value was being correctly set in the Smart Contract once deployed. I wrote the following simple test to ensure the value was indeed being set to '10':

```javascript
it('tax should exist', async() => {
    const newbCoinInstance = await NewbCoin.deployed();

    const tax = await newbCoinInstance.tax();
    assert.notEqual(tax, 0, "Tax value returned 0");
    assert.equal(tax, 10, "Tax did not equal 10%");
});
```

Although a very 'hard-coded' test, it helps quickly identify whether the tax is 0 or correct. Anything outside of these brackets will fail the test. The contract's tax() function is accessible as I changed the tax variable to be public using the keyword:

```javascript
uint public tax = 10;
```

With this in mind, I adapted the test case for token transfers to include the tax percentage from the contract rather than a hard coded amount within the test script. Once the 'aftertax' value is calculated, we can check that the receivers account is the value after tax, unlike previously whet it just checked that the raw amount had been deposited:

```javascript
// check our tax here
const tax = await newbCoinInstance.tax();
const afterTax = amount - (amount / tax);
assert.notEqual(tax, 0, "Tax value returned 0");

assert.equal(accountOneEndingBalance, accountOneStartingBalance - amount, "Amount wasn't correctly taken from the sender");
assert.equal(accountTwoEndingBalance, accountTwoStartingBalance + afterTax, "Amount wasn't correctly sent to the receiver");
```

Running our tests once more confirmed our adapted tests confirm our smart contract changes, and our newly implemented transaction tax:

![All tests passing](/assets/images/day_2/5_tax_tests_passing.png)

It should also be noted that the assert() function was changed to utilise the chai library. For some reason, my assert()'s just stopped working midway through developing the tax test hindering progress. Chai was installed with npm for future reference:

```bash
npm install chai --save
```

### Wash Up

I'm pretty happy with today's progress! I have pushed this working code to Github and can be seen [here](https://github.com/BadAtBlockchain/MetaCoin-goes-to-Harmony/tree/0cee22e87ce31f6cffe5748c7002366e38f9f69f).
