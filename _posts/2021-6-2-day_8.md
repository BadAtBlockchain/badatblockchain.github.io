### Starting Off With Some Web3

Today started off a little different with regards to the work I completed. Last night whilst reading about LootSwap, following along with their TG/Discord and reading their smart contract code - I realised the only interaction I have ever had with a mainnet contract is through the use of someone elses web application and a pre-written wallet (commonly MetaMask). I didn't really know how they were talking to the blockchains mainnet, I just blindly trust them with my wallet and give their app permission to do all the things.

The paranoid itch kicked in, so I dug in. First thing was first, how the hell does [Vfat](https://vfat.tools/harmony/loot/) work so flawlessly. This is a question I was able to partially answer by jumping on their [Github](https://github.com/vfat-tools/) and start routing around the code. Specifically the new [yield farming tool](https://github.com/vfat-tools/vfat-tools/blob/master/src/static/js/harmony_loot.js) released for LootSwap.

Each one of the scripts appears to talk to a different set of contracts, but as I am currently digging into LootSwap I figured I would check out what is going on here as it's apparent that I will be using both the LootSwap interface and Vfat to stake and claim.

Reading through the code, there appears to be a lot of clean, modularly written functionality that uses a range of other scripts and helpers throughout the repository. That is out of scope of my current post, however I did spend some time digging through and trying to pick out the bare minimum I would need to write some form of contract interaction between my local machine and the target contract. 

The list I came up with was:

- The target contract ABI (in this case, the loot chef)
- The target contract address (in this case, the loot chef)
- A wallet/provider to allow me to send transactions (call methods) to the smart contract
- An instance/connection to the contract
- Some target functions to call

The easiest approach to this was using vfat as a reference point but try and switch up the code where I can to prevent copy/pasta and not learning anything along the way!

I decided on using the following resources for my little project:

- nodejs
- web3
- @truffle/hdwallet-provider

A few major differences here compared to vfat (in my untrained eyes) is web3 instead of ethers, hdwallet-provider instead of just using the injected provider from MetaMask. This will allow me to run the process in the background without needing any form of browser or extension to be constantly open.

Once I was all set up, I created a quick project skeleton similar to [Gregory's](https://twitter.com/DappUniversity) script from his price bot [repository](https://github.com/dappuniversity/price-bot). Side note, if you haven't checked out his work yet - please do! I have watched all his Youtube videos but had to pass on the 50% off offer he sends out to people due to expendable cash. BUT, here we are. I nuked through his free content and now I'm following a path that suits me and feels great. He was definitely a starting point though and it helped me take leap I needed to (p.s CHECK HIM OUT).

Anyway...

Some specific information I needed to make sure I had in my .env file was:

- Harmony mainnet URL for the provider
- A wallet private key (generated a dummy wallet, obvs didn't use my own as my code can't be trusted yet!)

I will post a few snippets below in order of their script existence. I probably won't upload this code to Github just yet as it doesn't really do anything useful but if you would like to see the whole thing - ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/badatblockchain) and I'll send it over no problem!

Declaring a few things!

```javascript
// Wallet Config
const walletProvider = new HDWalletProvider(
	"0xPRIVATE_KEY", // wallet private key, I used a ETH friendly address
	'https://api.harmony.one' // mainnet
);

// WEB3 CONFIG
const web3 = new Web3(walletProvider)

// contract data (lifted from vfat - thank you!)
const LOOT_CHEF_ABI = <...snipped for length...>;
const LOOT_TOKEN_ADDR = "0xbDa99C8695986B45a0dD3979cC6f3974D9753D30";
const LOOT_CHEF_ADDR = "0xb96618aEBD36f8D83Fa03873FdA796264597604D";
const REWARD_TOKEN_TICKER = "LOOT";
```

Creating and talking to the contract:

```javascript
function interactWithContract(args) {
    const { outputTokenSymbol, outputTokenAddress, inputAmount } = args;

    const lootContract = new web3.eth.Contract(LOOT_CHEF_ABI, LOOT_CHEF_ADDR);

    let blockNumber = 0;
    await web3.eth.getBlockNumber().then((bn) => {
        blockNumber = bn;
    });

    let multiplier = 0;
    await lootContract.methods.getMultiplier(blockNumber, blockNumber+1).call().then((result) => {
        multiplier = result * 1; // force a cast to an int value
    });

    let rewardPerBlock = 0;
    await lootContract.methods.REWARD_PER_BLOCK().call().then((result) => {
        rewardPerBlock = result / 1e18; // divide to get the ETHER
    });
    
    // do whatever we want with our newly obtained contract data
}
```

The above code is unlikely optimised but it works. It allows me to query a contract on the Harmony mainnet using web3, I can run it as a background nodejs process and call the interactWithContract() function on loop using intervals. Glorious! It took me a little while to figure out how to actually call the functions but luckily, I took my own advice and read the [manual](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-contract.html#id32).

A slight side note: I haven't seen much development of bots, scripts, whatever which use the Harmony mainnet. Everything seems to be tailored to ETH so if you have stumbled across this looking for some Harmony examples - hopefully I am helping you out as much as I am helping myself out! If not, tweet me for some requests and I'll see what I can do.

Final output of my script looks like:

As can be seen, it looks very similar to the price-bot I linked previously. But it does what I set out to do - so no complaints from me!

### Back to My Solidity. Randomisation, How Can I Do It?

Yesterday I discussed digging into LootSwap and writing up some form of analysis on the smart contracts and notate as much as I possibly can to see how my progress is going. Well, that is working on the back burner and things are moving forward. But today, I wanted to jump back into Solidity and work on something of my own. I have a background in computer games programming, and one fascination I had during that time (and still do) is randomisation. I LOVE procedurally generated games. Generating worlds, characters, storylines, quests. You name it, if it's randomly generated, I'll like it.

This is where NFT's grab my attention. Things like [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), [Axies](https://axieinfinity.com/), etc. They all seem to have randomised features which helps produce an overall rarity factor and you can quantify(?) the cost relative to what the contract algorithm has generated. I know a few of them handled the generation off-chain, but I also know that there have been a range of smart contracts that have handled randomisation on chain. This is where I am interested. Now, gas prices and transaction speed/cost aside. I want to attempt to randomly generate some values within Solidity and have some test cases call these functions to help prove that each time I call the method, I get a different value back. Another note, I don't think I have seen any on-chain NFT's running on the Harmony blockchain yet, the 3 previous ones mentioned are all on the Ethereum platform. So if you read this and are working on something for ETH, throw it on Harmony and make me jealous that you beat me to it (but seriously, let's work on it together! Nudge me on Twitter)!

The first implementation of generating a random value was based on the following snippet:

```javascript
uint8(uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % 251);
```

The above hashes two values directly from the block (sender/user has no control over these values). From here the bytes32 hash from keccak256() is cast** to a uint256, modded with 251 to cap the maximum value to 255 (I believe) and finally cast to a uint8. A uint8 has 8 bits, with a maximum value of 255:

- Min value in binary (bit level): 00000000 => 0 (0-255)
- Max value in binary (bit level): 11111111 => 256 (0-255)

** Casting is a term I have obtained from other languages such as C++ where you can cast values from one to another by effectively wrapping the target value in a constructor or a casting type. In terms of Solidity, I'm not 100% sure if the lingo is accurate but the action appears to have the same outcome.

The above snippet was called several times using a for loop within a for loop. The function at this time was not of type 'view' so it returned objects rather than the required value however the randomisation can be seen:

![Initial randomisation values](/assets/images/day_8/2_random_uint8.png)

Sadly, based on testing these values all appeared to cap quite quickly and would ultimately result in clashes (this is due to the limit of 255 possibilities). If there were only a couple of hundred choices that needed to be randomised, then it would be perfect for selecting anything between 0 and 255. From here, the value can be [modded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) or divided further to cap the minimum and maximum value brackets even more. i.e dividing it by 51 would help cap to a maximum for 5.

My next attempt focused specifically on generating random hashes:

```javascript
function randomValue() public view returns (bytes32) {
	return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp));
}
```

I used the following test case to generate my hashes with separate calls and examined the results directly:

```javascript
describe('randomiser', async () => {
    it('random value', async () => {
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            const val = await marketplace.randomValue()
            console.log(val)
        }
    })
})
```

If you have hashed these values before, I think you will know what is coming in the next screenshot...

![Random hashes](/assets/images/day_8/3_random_hashes_clash.png)

As can be seen, all 5 values that were generated were all the same. I believe this is due to the execution time being LESS than 1 full block time (~2 seconds). As the block time had never elapsed, the timestamp was the same in every call so the final hash will always be the same too.

To help randomise this further and have a value that was different in every test case, I passed through the current index of the for loop to the smart contract method as a 'uint' parameter:

```javascript
function randomValue(uint i) public view returns (bytes32) {
	return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, i, block.timestamp));
}
```

I changed the test case to utilise this new parameter:

```javascript
describe('randomiser', async () => {
    it('random value', async () => {
        for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            const val = await marketplace.randomValue(i)
            console.log(val)
        }
    })
})
```

As can be seen in the following, this additional parameter helped force each result to be random based on the hashed content being changed per iteration, despite the execution time still being less than 1 block. The block times are likely still similar across several if not all the hashes.

Naturally, this isn't exactly the BEST use of randomisation and ultimately would only be an extremely small part of randomised code. But knowing how to generate random figures and having the freedom of different approaches just opens possibilities of randomly generating data, and ultimately NFTs! I will almost definitely be digging into this more and attempting randomly generate some NFT style content. Maybe even mint them on the mainnet - let's see how it goes!
