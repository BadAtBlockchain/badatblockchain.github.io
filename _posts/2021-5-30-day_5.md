### Does "Time" Exist in Smart Contracts - part 1?

I spend quite a lot of time messing with yield farms, staking and attempting to turn a profit whilst not failing at trading. This is one element of getting into the Harmony ecosystem that I have really fallen in love with. I love the validators, I love swap sites (Mochiswap is one I personally use) and other apps that are attempting to push a new incentive to people giving liquidity (etc). All in all, it seems safe (providing the contracts are legit) and anyone who owns the currency can earn free money! Imagine printing cash... only joking, don't have have to imagine anymore!

As this is something I really enjoy about the tokens I currently hold, I want to know how this works. It feels pretty overwhelming when I jot it on paper. To be honest, I'm still not sure I truly know how it works but I seem to turn a profit and I haven't succumbed to "[Impermanent Loss](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)" just yet. The following is a super dumb sketch that shows what my brain thinks truly happens:

![Yield Farm Flow](/assets/images/day_5/1_yield_farm_diagram.png)

The above diagram is *probably* not accurate so please feel free to correct me. But as far as I can tell (from an outsider and from reading some code on Git), the user sends a DEX/platform the required tokens (knowing a liquidity pool). This liquidity pool is held in a smart contract on the DEX. Once received, the LP contract returns a token to the user that represents the pair they have just submitted. This pair can now be adding to 'yield farms' that have been designed around this pair of tokens. In my diagram, the pair of tokens are from my super strong project, NewbCoin and DumbToken. Once combined, the user would receive a number of NC/DT LP tokens relative to the amount that has been added to the DEX liquidity pool. Once the LP token is added (known as staking), the farm's smarting contract must** keep a track of time which is then factored in to the reward calculation when the user withdraws their stake or claims their harvest. Withdrawing would remove their LP, and claiming their harvest would continue staking but just calculate their reward at that time.

** I say 'must' keep track of time, as I cannot think of any other way this could be done. In game, software, etc devs use time based on the system. Games use delta time for smooth lerps across network packets/frame updates, etc. So calculating the reward MUST factor time (somehow - more shortly).

What the diagram above doesn't show is how a user would reverse their LP token back into their originally pooled tokens. I assume it's literally just the reverse:

1. Identify LP tokens in application
2. Click 'unpair' or something similar
3. Receive originally staked amount/an amount relative to market value at that time

### Does "Time" Exist in Smart Contracts - part 2?

The previous section didn't exactly answer my question. It made it slightly more confusing and had a heavy focus on yield farming. But, time is money. Farming is money. Farming takes time to profit. TIME MUST EXIST IN BLOCKCHAIN, RIGHT?

Right! Sort of. I'm going to say yes, although it might not be 100% Big Ben accurate time, it's a linearly progressing value based on blocks. In Solidity, this can be accessed with the following:

```
uint256 _stopTime = block.timestamp;
```

"But bad, timestamp must mean it's a timestamp. So why are you confused?" - anyone, 2021

I don't know. For some reason, I just think blockchain works and there are no servers or computers powering it, like the cloud (kek). Turns out it's pretty simple and my mind was wondering away. The above snippet uses the global variable 'block.timestamp' which returns the current [Epoch value (Unix time)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). I am still yet to confirm whether or not these timestamps are then offset or skewed based on block time's of the target protocol. Definitely something I need to dig in further with more complex uses, but current face value tells me it's fairly straight forward.

### "Welcome to NewbFarm - A Non-Profit Waste of Time!"

As the title says, NewbFarm exists (testnet). I have written an EXTREMELY basic form of yield farming within a new smart contract. This farm only implements a very simple set of functionality:

- User can 'stake'
- User can 'withdraw'
- Calculates the time between stake and withdraw
- Tracks all users, their start time and whether they are staking, or not

As can be seen above, it's basic. It involves no tokens, a user doesn't stake anything. They simply start and get "rewarded" with how much time they waited before they withdraw. The following snippets will show each implemented function and a quick breakdown of what it does. The whole contract is visible on [Github](https://github.com/BadAtBlockchain/MetaCoin-goes-to-Harmony/blob/main/contracts/NewbFarm.sol) for easier reading.

**<u>State variables and event declarations:</u>**

```javascript
mapping(address => bool) public isStaking;
mapping(address => uint256) public startTimes;

event Stake(address indexed _addr, uint256 _startTime);
event Withdraw(address indexed _addr, uint256 _stopTime, uint _yieldTime);
```

- a map to state whether an address is already staking
- a map to hold the staking start time for an address

(I now realise I could just have a map of a custom struct that holds both these values but here we are!)

**<u>The stake function:</u>**

```javascript
function stake() public {
	require(!isStaking[msg.sender], "Sender is already staking!");

	uint256 _startTime = block.timestamp;
	isStaking[msg.sender] = true;
	startTimes[msg.sender] = _startTime;

	emit Stake(msg.sender, _startTime);
}
```

- Ensure the user is not already staking
- Get the current time of the block (epoch)
- Set the user's state to staking
- Set the time they started staking

**<u>The withdraw function:</u>**

```javascript
function withdraw() public {
    require(isStaking[msg.sender], "Sender is not staking at this time");
    
    uint256 _stopTime = block.timestamp;
    uint _yieldMinutes = calculateYieldTime(msg.sender, _stopTime);
    isStaking[msg.sender] = false;

    emit Withdraw(msg.sender, _stopTime, _yieldMinutes);
}
```

- Ensure the user is currently staking
- Get the current time of the block (epoch)
- Calculate the amount of time the user staked using the current block time (function call)
- Set the user's state to not staking

**<u>Function to calculate the amount of time the user 'staked' for:</u>**

```javascript
function calculateYieldTime(address _addr, uint256 _stopTime) public view returns(uint){
    uint _totalTime = _stopTime - startTimes[_addr];
    uint _totalTimeinMinutes = _totalTime / 60;
	return _totalTimeinMinutes;
}
```

- Take the user's address and the time the function was called (in this case, it's the same as withdraw)
- Calculate the difference between the two
- Divide this difference by 60 to get a value in minutes (we do this as epoch is in seconds)
- Return this value back to it's caller

On reflection, I feel like the calculateYieldTime() function should be a private/internal function AND it should check that the stopTime value is greater than the startTime. Although this should never fail, it would create some weird logical issues if this did occur.

### Compiling, Migrating, Testing

This process has been the same as previous contracts in this series. However, I figured out a pretty cool thing (likely obvious, but new to me). In the past, I have never really written code as well as write unit tests, so this whole approach is fresh, but I'm having a great time doing it! I can really see the benefits and catching bugs early.

Anyway, what I did figure out that I really liked was being able to just run one test file by itself:

```bash
truffle test test/newbfarm.js --network testnet
```

Pretty self-explanatory, but that will just run the single test file against the testnet contracts, where as NOT including the specific file path will execute all files within the test directory. As you can image, test times will increase dramatically as the project and contracts grow.

My NewbFarm test cases focus on the following 3 areas:

- Make sure a user can start and stop staking using stake() and withdraw()
- Make sure a user that is already staking cannot execute stake() again without it exiting early
- Make sure a user that is not staking cannot call withdraw() without it exiting early
