### CryptoZombies - What a Cool Platform!

About 5am this morning, I woke up because my cat decided to fur ball right next to our bed (10/10 would recommend). As all of us nerdy types do, we grab our phones and start scrolling. Today, rather than just getting depressed at all the negativity about everything I love, I came across [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/). Now, you may be thinking that I'm trying to shill some nonsense your way to earn an airdrop... wrong. This platform is far more than that, this is dropping free knowledge. The content here has pretty much helped me massively today from various angles. Let's dig in...

So what is Crypto Zombies? Well, the actual product is a blockchain based game based on Ethereum. But that isn't the important thing here. The platform teaches you how to build your own! They have step by step lessons with a browser based IDE (sort of) that checks your work and lets you continue if it's right...

... and throws a tonne of red at you if you are wrong.

The platform and tutorials are written and managed by [Loom](https://loomx.io/). I personally won't be digging in to this network, but please feel free to dig in and see what you think of their work and technology. I will be in the future but I don't want to get overwhelmed just yet! I have spent a fair amount of time today working through their course and so far, I absolutely love it. Not only have their gone into a good amount of detail about every step, but the tutorials are written in a very friendly way - super easy to understand and they are FREE!

I won't waffle on too much, if you want to learn Solidity in a nice controlled environment and my posts aren't doing it justice... go check their course out!

### Struct Packing

Today's new knowledge was thrown at my by the Crypto Zombie course. The first thing they have introduced to me that helped open my eyes was a concept known as 'struct packing'. Now before I go on, this concept is new to me in Solidity but the actual theory is something I used to do when I built computer games. My first introduction to this was writing OpenGL shaders and using variables in a specific manner to help optimise the memory's layout. It should also be noted that a lot of my hacking work involves memory manipulation and forms of abusing how the memory model works, so positioning data in memory to manipulate CPU registers (etc) is nothing new to me. But in the case of Solidity, this was definitely a valuable lesson to learn early on!

So, struct packing (as far as I understand it) is effectively just a clever way of making sure values use memory efficiently. Without going too much into memory specifics, for this immediate understanding, it is important to note that most common data types in Solidity take up 32 bytes of memory. If this is already confusing you, it might be worth quickly reading up on bits/bytes and memory. Sadly this is out of scope of my post and work. In Solidity, these common data types could be: 

- bytes32
- uint
- int

If I declare a uint value with the value 1, I actually waste a large amount of data considering the max value a uint256 (uint) could be:

```javascript
uint one = 1; // max of uint => 1.1579209e+77 ((2**256)-1)
```

Note: uint is just an alias in Solidity for uint256 (good to know when attempting to optimise).

Let's just picture the above variable in memory now. This might not be perfectly accurate but hopefully it gets the point across:

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001
```

As can be seen... that's an awful lot of wasted memory, especially if that 'one' value never changes. This is where struct packing can come in handy. By structuring variables carefully and logically, their initialisation in memory will actually utilise a single 32 byte slot where possible to store the values as their data types will limit them bleeding out into other bytes (hopefully... if not, we reach overflows which is a whole other story #safemath).

From what I have gathered today, it is important to use smaller data types where possible to attempt to enforce the use of struct packing and ultimately reduce the amount of memory/computation power required... reducing gas fees. Now, the Harmony me is screaming 'Hah.. what gas?' but from a 'developer trying to be smart' perspective, optimisations are important! Let's attempt a quick example of how two variables in one 32 byte slow might look like!

```
bytes16 a = "AAAA"; // 128 bits
uint16 b = "1";		// 16 bits
uint16 c = "2";		// 16 bits
uint8  d = "3";		// 8 bits
```

In an attempt to present what this would look like in memory... here we go (remember, this is one 32 byte slot of memory):

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 41414141 
00000000 00000001 00000000 00000002
00000003 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
```

I must express how much I likely butchered that above representation but you should be able to gather what the packed struct should look like compared to how the single uint value previously described look. Even with the possibility of my accuracy being off, the idea is pretty obvious that memory is saved if done correctly!

### External and Internal Functions

This section will be slightly less overwhelming than the previous but the following points highlight the different 'visibility(?)' keywords I have come across so far for each function:

- Private
  - Only the contract can call it's own private methods. Safer, but limiting.
- Public
  - Anyone or anything can call these functions (potentially dangerous and open to attackers/hackers). Try restrict the use of public functions to help lower the overall attack surface on a smart contract.
- Internal
  - These types of functions are the same as 'private' functions, however, contracts that inherit contracts with 'internal' functions can also call these functions. Inherited contracts do not expose their 'private' functions.

- External
  - These can only be called from outside of the contract. Their visibility is similar to 'public' functions but cannot be called by the contract themselves.

Whilst on the topic of 'external' functions, it is worth noting briefly that a storage keyword is only available to 'external' functions. This is the 'calldata' keyword. Calldata is similar to the 'memory' keyword but allows data to be bought in to the smart contract via external function calls.
