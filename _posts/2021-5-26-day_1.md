### Initial Steps

First task of today was getting this pages site set up.

- I forked jekyll-now, edited the config file and deployed it to the badatblockchain.github.io repository (themeing can wait for future steps)
- Next step was to shill my progress, so I set up a Twitter for posting everything and joining the other hashtag users

### The Fun Begins - Diving into Smart Contract-ing

I already had truffle installed from the official website, and had a specific VM set up. For development and testing I'm just using Ubuntu 20.04, but will likely migrate everything to Mac OSX in the future (Desktop is a Mac, laptop is an XPS running Windows 10. I run VM's in vmware.)

First things first, let's take the default MetaCoin project from truffle and attempt to get it to compile and run on the Harmony testnet!

I grabbed the MetaCoin project with truffle:

```bash
mkdir newbcoin
cd newbcoin
truffle unbox metacoin
```

Opening up the project in vscode, I navigated straight to the place truffle-config.js file knowing this is where the testnet data would be. I replaced the entire file with the following which I was able to find and adapt an example from a [Github project](https://github.com/harmony-one/HRC/blob/master/examples/hrc20/truffle-config.js):

```js
require("dotenv").config();
const { TruffleProvider } = require("@harmony-js/core");

//Local
const local_mnemonic = process.env.LOCAL_MNEMONIC;
const local_private_key = process.env.LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY;
const local_url = process.env.LOCAL_0_URL;

//Testnet
const testnet_mnemonic = process.env.TESTNET_MNEMONIC;
const testnet_private_key = process.env.TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY;
const testnet_url = process.env.TESTNET_0_URL;

//Mainnet
const mainnet_mnemonic = process.env.MAINNET_MNEMONIC;
const mainnet_private_key = process.env.MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY;
const mainnet_url = process.env.MAINNET_0_URL;

//GAS - Currently using same GAS accross all environments
gasLimit = process.env.GAS_LIMIT;
gasPrice = process.env.GAS_PRICE;

module.exports = {
  networks: {
    local: {
      network_id: "2", // Any network (default: none)
      provider: () => {
        const truffleProvider = new TruffleProvider(
          local_url,
          { memonic: local_mnemonic },
          { shardID: 0, chainId: 2 },
          { gasLimit: gasLimit, gasPrice: gasPrice }
        );
        const newAcc = truffleProvider.addByPrivateKey(local_private_key);
        truffleProvider.setSigner(newAcc);
        return truffleProvider;
      },
    },
    testnet: {
      network_id: "2", // Any network (default: none)
      provider: () => {
        const truffleProvider = new TruffleProvider(
          testnet_url,
          { memonic: testnet_mnemonic },
          { shardID: 0, chainId: 2 },
          { gasLimit: gasLimit, gasPrice: gasPrice }
        );
        const newAcc = truffleProvider.addByPrivateKey(testnet_private_key);
        truffleProvider.setSigner(newAcc);
        return truffleProvider;
      },
      skipDryRun: true,
    },
    mainnet: {
      network_id: "1", // Any network (default: none)
      provider: () => {
        const truffleProvider = new TruffleProvider(
          mainnet_url,
          { memonic: mainnet_mnemonic },
          { shardID: 0, chainId: 1 },
          { gasLimit: gasLimit, gasPrice: gasPrice }
        );
        const newAcc = truffleProvider.addByPrivateKey(mainnet_private_key);
        truffleProvider.setSigner(newAcc);
        return truffleProvider;
      },
    },
  },
  contracts_directory: './src/contracts/',
  contracts_build_directory: './src/abis/',
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.5.0",
      settings: {
        optimizer: {
          enabled: true,
          runs: 200,
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

In order to run truffle, compile the contracts, deploy, etc I would need a range of modules from NPM. These were installed using the following (I'm using nodejs for the deployment and what not):

```bash
npm install dotenv --save
npm install @harmony-js/core --save
npm install tslib --save
```

We can now successfully run things like:
```bash
bc@ubuntu:~/Desktop/newbcoin$ truffle compile

Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.
```

Apparently it all compiled but when attempting to run the following, I hit issues:

```bash
truffle migrate --network testnet --reset
```

I nuked the TestMetaCoin.sol file as this was claiming errors similar to the following: https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/issues/2702

Couldn't figure this out, but deleting the solidity file appeared to help with compilation. I will dig further into this Test contract file in the future but for now my goal is to just get this thing running.

After a little while it turns out I'm actually dafter than I thought and COMPLETELY forgot to populate the process with environment variables. The config file gathers information from the environment variables which I completely forgot about. To satisfy these, I created the following .env file with the base directory of the the project:

```bash
//LOCAL
//Local uses account one103q7qe5t2505lypvltkqtddaef5tzfxwsse4z7 on Shard 0
LOCAL_PRIVATE_KEY='45e497bd45a9049bcb649016594489ac67b9f052a6cdf5cb74ee2427a60bf25e'
LOCAL_MNEMONIC='urge clog right example dish drill card maximum mix bachelor section select' 
LOCAL_0_URL='http://localhost:9500'

//TESTNET
//Account: one18t4yj4fuutj83uwqckkvxp9gfa0568uc48ggj7
TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY='01F903CE0C960FF3A9E68E80FF5FFC344358D80CE1C221C3F9711AF07F83A3BD'
TESTNET_MNEMONIC='urge clog right example dish drill card maximum mix bachelor section select' 

TESTNET_0_URL='https://api.s0.b.hmny.io'
TESTNET_1_URL='https://api.s1.b.hmny.io'

//MAINNET
//Please replace MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY and MAINNET_MNEMONIC with your own!
//Account: one18t4yj4fuutj83uwqckkvxp9gfa0568uc48ggj7
MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY='01F903CE0C960FF3A9E68E80FF5FFC344358D80CE1C221C3F9711AF07F83A3BD'
MAINNET_MNEMONIC='urge clog right example dish drill card maximum mix bachelor section select' 
MAINNET_0_URL='https://api.s0.t.hmny.io'

GAS_LIMIT=3321900
GAS_PRICE=1000000000
```

The above keys, mnemonics and everything else are not mine (or sensitive for that matter). The only one I care about here is the testnet information, but the rest is populated for completion.

Re-running the following command gave me some better output which gave me more faith:

```bash
truffle migrate --network testnet --reset
```

Once deployed, we can now run the pre-written test file "metacoin.js" within the tests directory. This test file is already written for us and performs the following tests:

- Obtaining the first account and ensuring there are 10000 tokens in it's balance (the token is minted with a supply of 10000)
- Performs a call to a linked library. This linked library is another solidity file.
- Send 10 tokens from one account to another and confirm their balances represent this subtraction and addition
