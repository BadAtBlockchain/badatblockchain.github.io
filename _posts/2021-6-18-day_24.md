### Randomly Selecting An Object From a Pool

As mentioned yesterday (Day 23), I wanted to create a small smart contract that allows a user to all a function and have a random value returned from this function. First, I should probably give a small brief on why you may want to do this, and what sort of use case it might have...

So, the Wicked Craniums release tomorrow. And it's the first Ethereum based avatar project I am going to be participating in. With their launch, I am going to attempt to mint a cranium (along with all other exciting fans) so hopefully I get one! Anyway, this minting process will assign the 'sender' a random cranium from a pool. If we imagine there are only 10,000 craniums (it's a little more, but for easy numbers we will use 10,000). There will likely be an array of all of these craniums. This array will likely hold a struct of information relating to each cranium. All data will exist on the blockchain, as defined by the developers along with their randomly generated image which holds randomly selected traits (to determine rarity, etc). This array will be static in size, and will never change (to add scarcity to the craniums via a hard limited supply - assisting economics of the token (tokenomics, if you will)). Alongside the array will be a map. This map will probably hold the token ID as the key, and an address as the value. This can then be used to determine who owns the skull and who does not.

The minting process will likely be similar to the following:

- Loop through the array
- Check if the current index (token id) of the array has an owner using the map
- If not, add it to a new, local scope array (memory storage)
- Create a random hash using keccak and some sender + block relative data
- Mod the hash value by the length (N) of the array (if greater than 1)
- By now we should have a value between 0 and N (0, if the array length was only 1)
- Assign this token to the sender's address (new owner found)

Below is the first iteration of the smart contract code. I won't break it down too much as it pretty much just does the above bullet points, we some extra code I had to add as I couldn't figure out other ways to do it (if you spot something silly, please let me know on Twitter!).

```javascript
constructor() {
    name = "Super Rare Token!";
    symbol = "SRT";
    supply = 100;
    totalMinted = 0;

    for (uint8 i = 0; i < supply; i++) {
        DataObj memory newData = DataObj("https://some.url");
        allTokens.push(newData);
    }
}

function mint() public payable returns (uint256) {
    require(totalMinted < supply, "All tokens minted");

    // horrible but may be required to get a value for the following array?
    uint8 count = 0;
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < supply; i++) {
        if (owners[i] == address(0)) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    uint8[] memory availableTokens = new uint8[](count);

    // first get all objects that are not owned
    uint8 loopTracker = 0;
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < supply; i++) {
        if (owners[i] == address(0)) {
            availableTokens[loopTracker] = i; // i is the available token ID from the overall array
            loopTracker++; // loop tracker maintains our position in the availableTokens array
        }
    }

    // 'count' should still be our length of available tokens
    uint randHash = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender)));
    uint256 selection = randHash % count;

    emit MintData(supply, count, selection);
    return selection;
}
```

Once written, I created the following test case to ensure that the mint function works and emits and random index of the 'availableTokens' array:

```javascript
it('should mint', async () => {
    // attempting to mint
    result = await superRareToken.mint();
    var args = result.logs[0].args;
    console.log(args);
    console.log("Result: " + args.randomIndex.toNumber());
});
```

The output from this test can be seen below:

```
  __length__: 3,
  totalTokens: BN {
    negative: 0,
    words: [ 100, <1 empty item> ],
    length: 1,
    red: null
  },
  availableTokens: BN {
    negative: 0,
    words: [ 100, <1 empty item> ],
    length: 1,
    red: null
  },
  randomIndex: BN {
    negative: 0,
    words: [ 75, <1 empty item> ],
    length: 1,
    red: null
  }
}

	✓ should mint (5114ms)
```

As can be seen, the 3 values "100", "100", and "75" were emitted. Looking at the event parameters, we can see that "75" was the random index. It works!

The next test case was written to check the results of 5 consecutive mints:

```javascript
it('should mint 5', async () => {
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        console.log("Attempt: " + i + 1);
        result = await superRareToken.mint();
        var args = result.logs[0].args;
        console.log("Total Supply: " + args.totalTokens.toNumber());
        console.log("Available Tokens: " + args.availableTokens.toNumber());
        console.log("Random Index: " + args.randomIndex.toNumber());
        console.log("");
    }
});
```

The following was the test case output:

```
Attempt: 1
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 100
Random Index: 92

Attempt: 2
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 100
Random Index: 22

Attempt: 3
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 100
Random Index: 63

Attempt: 4
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 100
Random Index: 54

Attempt: 5
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 100
Random Index: 55

	✓ should mint 5 (19496ms)
```

As can be seen, the available token never changes. I need to ensure we assign this token ID to the address of the sender, theoretically reducing the total available. As it stands, different users could mint the same token, as well as infinitely mint tokens despite there only being 100 available. In this case, there were no clashes with obtained tokens, but thankfully the test case does show that the contract is generating random values between 0 and 100 each time! Progress. 

The following snippet shows the contract changes which were made to:

1. match the initial bullet points at the top of the post
2. address the issues stated in the above paragraph

First I changed the state variable "totalMinted" type and the MintData event parameters to include this value:

```javascript
uint8 totalMinted;

event MintData(uint8 totalTokens, uint8 availableTokens, uint8 totalMinted, uint256 randomIndex);
```

Next, we add the logic to ensure the mint function registers the purchase of this token.

```javascript
// 'count' should still be our length of available tokens
uint randHash = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(block.timestamp, msg.sender)));
uint256 selection = randHash % count;

// ---- new code below
require(owners[selection] == address(0), "Token is already owned?! Failed");

// increment the total minted and assign the token to the new owner (sender)
totalMinted++;
owners[selection] = msg.sender;

emit MintData(supply, count, totalMinted, selection);
```

The 2nd test case was adapted to also output this "totalMinted" value. The newly adapted smart contract's test output can be seen below:

```
Attempt: 1
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 99
Total minted: 2
Random Index: 83

Attempt: 2
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 98
Total minted: 3
Random Index: 71

Attempt: 3
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 97
Total minted: 4
Random Index: 62

Attempt: 4
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 96
Total minted: 5
Random Index: 66

Attempt: 5
Total Supply: 100
Available Tokens: 95
Total minted: 6
Random Index: 43

    ✓ should mint 5 (22669ms)
```

Excellent! As can be seen in the above output, the contract now keeps track of the token's new ownership and our array loops account for this within the available tokens value emitted each time. What appears weird (and a bug) is the available tokens and the total minted. They both appear to be one value off but remember, the 1st test case will snipe the first available token and our second case's values will be start with 99 available and 1 already minted. The final code can be seen on my Github [here](https://github.com/BadAtBlockchain/random_object_contract). 

It should be noted that this is not perfect, it probably has a range of optimisations available to it and additional security measures. But it does what I wanted it to do, and I'm happy that I have hit my goal with generating a random token ID from a range of available tokens. Further work could be done to get the balance of an address (how many tokens they own), and also obtain each token a user owns by using a similar approach. We could build an array of all the tokens within a 0 address, loop this array and get the address from the map. If the map address matches the sender, we store it ready to be returned. Another option would be to utilise the ERC721 enumerable standard and inherit the tried and tested code and functionality (recommended).
