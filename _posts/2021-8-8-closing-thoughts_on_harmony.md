## My Overall Thoughts on Harmony

#### This post has been updated, please see the end for edits.

I have held a fair few tokens across the Harmony network for a little over 4 months now. I've had my $ONE rise up and down with the market, and I've been able to enjoy some yield farming to help provide liquidity to new DEX platforms, their governance tokens and to help grow my own portfolio. 

My immediate response when anyone asks, "So what do you think of Harmony?" I just reply with some meme based response that either includes a lambo or a moon, that's honestly what I thought for my entire time with the community. Note the word 'thought' in that sentence... keep that in mind for later.

#### Positives

Let's first start off with the positives of the network, because there is a fair few from both a personal point of a view, and an overall point of view. From my point of view, there has been several good points that have really helped me on my journey so far:

- Harmony is basically just a copy/paste of ETH. So learning the development lifecycle has helped prepare me for both platforms
- The only documentation is great, some of the developers and maintainers of Harmony projects are happy to talk about the technical stuff
- Some community tooling exists to help newcomers to blockchain development
- I was able to get started with yield farming with around $100. Gas was so low, I could afford to mess up and still turn a profit with a few days. This was a really attractive aspect to me.

The positives about the overall network:

- Harmony is fast. I mean, it feels really fast. I love using ETH for NFT's, but bouncing between the two - you can certainly feel the difference.
- Harmony is cheap. When deploying, performing contract transactions, buying tokens. It costs next to nothing each time. This may change if Harmony goes the same direction as ETH and ends up going to ~$4000/ONE just based on the percentage/fraction of gas to token. But I'm not well versed in tokenomics or gas estimation so I can only give my initial thoughts on this. It isn't back up by any form of information.
- It seems to have some die hard fans of the technology.
- There are some good projects out on the platform for everyone to use. There are a range of dex platforms for people to choose from (Loot, Viper, Mochi etc), as well as a selection of tokens to invest in and farm (Moonity, Loot, Coink, etc).

From a quick brainstorm, that's a pretty good selection of positives that first come to mind. For anyone new to blockchain, I think Harmony could be a good place to start. But that being said, I probably wouldn't recommend it after my time here as there are definitely some issues that, in my opinion, are going to kill the project overall. 

#### Negatives

Before I start, the upcoming list has been accumulated from my experience on the platform. These may or may not have occurred to other people. I'm not affiliated with Harmony in a professional manner. I have been working on a live platform on Harmony for a little while now as a developer, and even though I truly enjoy it and support the project, I think in the long run. Harmony is going to flop, let me list out my problems with it and hopefully give a better overall explanation:

- There have been RPC issues since (my) day 1. Now, I'm not an actual blockchain developer, I write smart contracts. I don't develop the actual technology I piggyback off. But this is seriously, my biggest issue with the network. I launched an NFT collection last week with a custom minting app. The code I wrote for the minting app worked perfectly fine on the testnet for both Harmony and Eth. I ran a range of unit tests, consistently querying the contract for data and embedding it in the site. To this end, I thought I caught every edge case and error that I came across. Apparently not. The site and collection go live, I push the name out - DM's come in saying the site is erroring because of something I hadn't seen, at all before. Panic sets in, I immediately start cloning my code and building a second app to see what might have gone wrong. Debugging everything as much as I can. Anyway, turns out the RPC was having issues and I was just inheriting the negative reputation and feedback. Cool. Project flopped because the foundations (that I can't control) were pants. 

- For some reason, and I'm not personally attacking anyone here - it's an overall vibe. Posting projects and work we are excited about in Harmony community Telegram posts is frowned upon. Yeah, right? I built my project, I was really happy that I got it working all on-chain, with no external service requirements. Basically, once minted, it survived until the end of Harmony (which if they actually play their cards right, could be forever). Anyway, a description/pitch was written, followed by the link, followed by a little "@devs if this is against the rules of that chat, please let me know." Almost immediately, the message was being "/report"ed, people were quoting it tagging the admins. I mean, come on. It felt like I was in a playground. It was reported quicker than someone could read the first line. After about 30 seconds I just nuked the message and left the chat. That was the main Harmony Telegram group btw - where, I guess, everyone on the actual network exists. How are we supposed to promote the work we are proud of to users of Harmony if we can't talk to them? I should probably state here, the project was not designed to make me money, it was designed to learn something and help others who are new/veterans to understand how on-chain generation can work. It could have been a cool project, but apparently that's not allowed so it's gone. Probably nuke the contract and move it over to Ethereum.
- My main other issue is the money in Harmony. Yes, there is some. Yes, new projects seem to blow up quickly (but not for long it seems) and yes, there is active volume. These are all positives, I know. However, when you actually look at the group chats for projects that pump. It's all the same people every time. So in theory, people are just passing money between each other - giving a new token some liquidity and value, and then cashing out to get their money back. I have seen different projects boom then fall throughout this trend including Mochi, Mooni flew up on launch, Loot blew up over night. Guilds probably did quite well. But it's all the same money (from my guessing). And I only guess this, because Binance seems to have a terrible relationship with the Harmony technology. I'm not going in to that because I don't really know what their problems are, but if Binance is the first place people go to buy tokens - and the token they want isn't for sale because of technical issues, well... no more money is coming into the ecosystem.

#### My Conclusion of My Time Here

At first, I loved it. I thought I found my forever chain. But I think I'm done. Projects I love are dying, their owners are losing faith in the technology the work sits on and are moving on. Communities aren't that friendly and welcoming, some of the admins are great - but the users can be toxic (but this is the internet after all so you do get children everywhere). Everyone is out for themselves (naturally) and there hasn't been a great sense of community drive, considering Harmony (in my eyes) seemed to be the network that was pushing to the masses and trying to include everyone. But when that everyone doesn't seem to factor in devs who are proud of their work, it seems like it will be a dead network in the next couple of years. Sadly, I don't think I'll be sticking around. Nothing is set in stone but I think I'll go over to Ethereum to push out some work and join some teams over there. Do some outside research into some up and coming protocols and networks that seem to be matching Harmony with regards to speed/costs and see how there communities and projects are. At the end of the day, I'm not here to make money. I want to enjoy my time spent and build some cool stuff. I don't want to build on top of flawed technology and try and include people who just don't seem nice and friendly. 

If anyone read this far, and if you're a big fan of Harmony. Don't flip your lid and start shouting about this post. I don't want to put people off. My experiences will differ to everyone else. I may misinterpret things that are said, I may just invite the wrong people in. It doesn't really matter. Just keep doing your own research, and enjoy it :)

#### Edit 12/8/2021:  
After discussing the above with a few members of the Harmony community and the wider blockchain community. I came to a resolution. That resolution was nothing to do with the target network or any toxicity I may have come across. I chose to start my venture on Harmony because it was new, fresh and it was a growing ecosystem was potential. It still is.  I didn't start messing around with Solidity and smart contracts to buy a lambo and a yacht. I started to learn something new. I want to help others learn. I want to help others succeed. I shouldn't let others get to me, because when they do, other people potentially miss out because I didn't take a hit. For this reason, I am going to continue working on my current existing projects. I want to get them launched. I have some cool little projects that are helping me learn and further my knowledge with smart contract development, but they are also heavily designed around charity donations and the token holders. Apologies if the rest of the post was a bit off putting, it was posted at a time of stress and I just didn't know how to react. I now have the wider goal solely in my vision and I don't plan on slowing down just because a few voices on the internet push back. Thanks.
