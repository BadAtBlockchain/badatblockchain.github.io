## Sorry For The Absence

If you were following along with my daily posts on my 100daysofcode progress, I first want to apologise for just disappearing. Work got busy, personal projects got busy and ultimately life just got busy. Prioritising my development time resulted in reducing windows of opportunity to write up my daily work and post them online. 

I wanted to give a quick update here on overall progress, what I've been dabbling with and where I currently stand with Blockchain.

### My Solidity Progress

The language has become increasingly easy over the past month of silence. Development just flows out my finger tips, contracts are written relatively quickly and smoothly and my dev life cycle practices have become relatively efficient. I am building tools to help harness new projects, I have been writing and maintaining a range of unit test cases for all contracts to attempt to find weird edge cases and ensure logic works as intended. As well as this, just reading Solidity has become so much easier.

One huge help I can honestly swear by is just building random contracts and attempt to build some form of 'product'. Even if these don't go anywhere, the time spent developing them is priceless and the amount of knowledge that can be learnt is incredible!

I actually have a base project created that has been released publicly that helped my streamline my development. Instead of just using truffle and the Harmony testnet to create and test my projects, I have been using a combination of Harmony, Truffle, Waffle and Mocha to build, deploy and test all of my current contracts. The speed difference is insane, and I genuinely don't know how I missed these (I do, I'm not a developer anymore... so I'm sure it's super common to do this kind of thing). I plan to do a write up on this project, explaining everything and why it's helped me. But for now, here's the link to the Git:

Repo: [https://github.com/BadAtBlockchain/harmony-truffle-yarn-base-project](https://github.com/BadAtBlockchain/harmony-truffle-yarn-base-project)

Pretty much just clone it, edit it, yarn, compile it then test!

### Personal Projects

There are a couple of undisclosed projects I have been working on in my spare time, all based around Harmony. I've fallen in love with NFT's with the recent boom of profile picture projects (mainly Wicked Craniums (massive heart emoji)) I have just been non-step writing ERC721 contracts. It's all with a goal of releasing my own projects with a friend, but if you (the reader) have some ideas, can do digital art or just want to build something. Reach out! I want to build stuff and let's lambo together (or atleast Punto...). These are not public right now, but if they launch - I will obviously be making noise about them, if they don't launch, I will likely make them open source for others to learn from! After all, that's the only reason I am here:

open source + guess work = badatblockchain
