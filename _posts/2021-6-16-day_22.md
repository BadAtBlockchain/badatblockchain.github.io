### It Still Hasn't Clicked

How does yield farming, pairing, routing, everything actually work?! I honestly have no idea. When running through the moon token on Day 20, I (again) saw the use of UniSwap's interfaces. But why does this token need it and the hard cap token from Day 21 doesn't?

Can the hard cap token not be swapped on a DEX? What additional functionality does the moon token get from including these interfaces. I just don't get it! If someone reads this and has minted some tokens using these interfaces and has a few minutes to ping me an idiots guide, then I would massively appreciate the time!

For now though, I am sticking to reads such as:

[https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contract-integration/providing-liquidity/](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contract-integration/providing-liquidity/)

[https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contract-integration/trading-from-a-smart-contract/](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contract-integration/trading-from-a-smart-contract/)

[https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/SDK/getting-started/](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/SDK/getting-started/)

[https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/factory#address](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/factory#address)

I need to dig in more and probably just try and deploy a DEX to the testnet for debugging. 

To be honest, the documentation for UniSwap is really nice. It's clear, clean and has lot's of examples. For some reason, it just isn't embedding itself in my brain.
