#### Structs, let's dig in!

I've always looked at structs as a basic version of a class (especially in object oriented programming languages). I use a lot of structs in Golang, for example. Structs act as my objects, and these structs are then created as objects which are unique and can have functions assigned to them (etc).

Solidity doesn't seem too far off this, and should transfer relatively easily with similar use cases. An example of using a struct for a yield farm user in Golang can be seen below:

```go
type StakerInfo struct {
    address string
    isStaking bool
}

info := &StakerInfo{
    address: "0x0",
    isStake: true,
}
```

Further examples can be seen [here](https://gobyexample.com/structs).

The above snippet declares a struct called StakerInfo. A variable is then assigned a pointer to a struct which has been populated with some information for further use. This value could then be passed to other functions, stored in a slice, etc.

Now, in Solidity, these appear to be relatively similar ([ref](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/solidity_structs.htm)). You declare a struct, create one and store it. The values can then be accessed whenever. In Solidity, declaring and using a struct could look like the following:

```javascript
struct StakerInfo { 
    bool _isStaking;
    uint256 _timeStarted;
}

StakerInfo stakerInfo;

// function body
{
	return stakerInfo._isStaking;
}
```

#### Updating NewbFarm to Include My New Struct

Currently, NewbFarm uses 2 separate maps within it's state variables to track the time a user started staking and whether or not they are staking at that time. Whilst writing up day 5's post, I quickly realised I could simplify this and use 1 map with the address and a struct of the required variables.

I'm not too sure how different the overhead would be, but having one map to use for address look ups *might* my cheaper than 2 maps, especially as these maps get larger over time and usage. But I will need to dig in deeper in the future and confirm this. 

Before I make the changes, I just want to add a snippet of how it currently looks and an example of using one of the maps within a function:

```javascript
mapping(address => bool) public isStaking;
mapping(address => uint256) public startTimes;

// stake function body
isStaking[msg.sender] = true;
startTimes[msg.sender] = _startTime;
```

As can be seen above, both maps are accessed using the same address value (msg.sender). This could be changed to one map look up, followed by setting the maps value to a struct of the same information. In my head, that will be cheaper but I'm not comfortable enough with this language to state that in court - so, correct me if I'm wrong please!

After updating my NewbFarm smart contract, I now have the following declarations:

```javascript
// mapping(address => bool) public isStaking;
// mapping(address => uint256) public startTimes;
mapping(address => StakeInfo) public stakers;
```

I then adapted the stake function to look like the following:

```javascript
require(!stakers[msg.sender]._isStaking, "Sender is already staking!");
//require(_amount > 0, 'You must stake more than 0 tokens');

uint256 _startTime = block.timestamp;

// set the state variables to acknowlege the senders stake start time and set their staking state to TRUE
// NOTE: research and see if we need to create the object or is the mapping already does this for us.
StakeInfo memory _stakeInfo;
_stakeInfo._isStaking = true;
_stakeInfo._timeStarted = _startTime;
// isStaking[msg.sender] = true;
// startTimes[msg.sender] = _startTime;
stakers[msg.sender] = _stakeInfo;
```

Note: the stake function does not care whether or not the address already has a valid struct within the map. This could be altered to search for this struct first and update it, rather than create a whole new one. Another point I need to research and dig in to is the actual creation of the struct value that is placed in the map itself. 

The withdraw function was also adapted:

```javascript
StakeInfo memory _stakeInfo = stakers[msg.sender];
require(_stakeInfo._isStaking, "Sender is not staking at this time");
// require(isStaking[msg.sender], "Sender is not staking at this time");
uint256 _stopTime = block.timestamp;

uint _yieldMinutes = calculateYieldTime(_stakeInfo, _stopTime);

//isStaking[msg.sender] = false;
_stakeInfo._isStaking = false;
stakers[msg.sender] = _stakeInfo;
```

Calculating the yield time has had it's parameters and body changed to reflect the new implementation:

```javascript
function calculateYieldTime(StakeInfo memory _stakeInfo, uint256 _stopTime) public pure returns(uint){
    uint _totalTime = _stopTime - _stakeInfo._timeStarted;
    uint _totalTimeinMinutes = _totalTime / 60;
    return _totalTimeinMinutes;
}
```

The snippets above show 2 new keywords that have been used whilst making these changes to the source code. These are "memory" and "pure". To briefly summarise both of these:

- The "memory" keyword can only be used within methods, and works in a similar way to the 'new' keyword in other languages. Based on some quick research, this memory keyword has the method create a chunk of space to store these variables at runtime rather than compile time. Without this keyword, the variable would be stored in the smart contract's storage.
- The "pure" keyword ensures that the function does not alter the state variable values of the smart contract.

All in all, whether I have optimised with regards to overhead/gas, I learnt about structs and found out another way to do the same thing! Profit all around. Looking at the test values (specifically the execution time for each test), tests 2 and 3 seem to be quicker.

I can't say for certain whether this has optimised my functions but if the test case ms times are anything to go by, our update to a single map and struct per staker seems to have been a win!
